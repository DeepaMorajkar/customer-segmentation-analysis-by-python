# customer-segmentation-analysis-by-python

This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm. The dataset contains information about customers, including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

The project follows the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes and analyzes the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, relationships between variables, and any patterns or trends present.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocesses the data by standardizing the numerical columns to ensure they are on the same scale.

K-means Clustering: Applies the K-means algorithm to cluster the customers based on their standardized features. The number of clusters is determined based on the elbow method and silhouette score.

Adding Cluster Labels: Adds the cluster labels to the original dataset to associate each customer with a specific cluster.

Cluster Analysis and Visualization: Analyzes and visualizes the resulting clusters to gain insights into customer segments. This includes plotting scatter plots, box plots, histograms, or any other relevant visualizations to understand the characteristics of each cluster.
